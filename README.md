### Learn how to use Blenders  

Learn how to write coroutine code:  
co-routine/yield mechanism

So, if we take a unit vector (Vector3.forward), multiply it by a three-axis rotation (camera.rotation), and scale it by a length (100.0f), we'll get a ray pointing in the same direction as the camera, measuring 100 units long:  
ray = new Ray (camera.position, camera.rotation * Vector3.forward);
